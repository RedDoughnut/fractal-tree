# fractal-tree
Program for drawing [fractal trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_canopy) in Pygame

# Configuration
At the beginning of the `main()` function, you’ll find several constants such as:
- `ANGLE` — branch rotation angle (in radians)
- `RATIO` — branch length ratio
- `DEPTH` — recursion depth
- `START_LENGTH` — starting branch length

Modify these to create trees of different shapes and complexity.
